\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience.  Please read
                                previous years' Proceedings to understand the writing style and
                                conventions that successful authors have used.  It is particularly
                                important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
                                you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
                                published work, i.e., what is the unique contribution that your work
                                makes to the field?  Please consider what the reader will learn from
                                your submission, and how they will find your work useful.  If you
                                write with these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be
                                successful, both in being accepted into the Conference, and in
                                influencing the work of our field.
