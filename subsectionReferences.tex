\subsection{References and Citations}

Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered
                                alphabetically by first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets
                                \cite{ethics,
                                  Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378,
                                  Mather:2000:MUT,
                                  Zellweger:2001:FAO:504216.504224}. For
                                papers from conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and
                                an abbreviated name of the conference (e.g., for Interact 2003
                                proceedings, use \textit{Proc. Interact 2003}). Do not include the
                                location of the conference or the exact date; do include the page
                                numbers if available. See the examples of citations at the end of this
                                document. Within this template file, use the \texttt{References} style
                                for the text of your citation.

Your references should be published materials accessible to the
                                public.  Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
                                easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the
                                report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a
                                nominal fee.  Proprietary information may not be cited. Private
                                communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced
                                (e.g., ``[Robertson, personal communication]'').
