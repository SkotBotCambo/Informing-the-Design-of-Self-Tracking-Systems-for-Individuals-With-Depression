\section{Blind Review}

For archival submissions, CHI requires a ``blind review.'' To prepare
                                your submission for blind review, remove author and institutional
                                identities in the title and header areas of the paper. You may also
                                need to remove part or all of the Acknowledgments text.  Further
                                suppression of identity in the body of the paper and references is
                                left to the authors' discretion. For more details, see the submission
                                guidelines and checklist for your submission category.
