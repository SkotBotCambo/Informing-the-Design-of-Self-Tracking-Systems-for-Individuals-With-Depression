\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
                                before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
                                Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
                                {\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
                                will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 7. This is
                                widely available at no cost from~\cite{acrobat}.  Note that most
                                reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
                                reader, which cannot handle documents containing non-North American or
                                non-European fonts (e.g. Asian fonts).  Please therefore do not use
                                Asian fonts, and verify this by testing with a North American/European
                                Acrobat reader (obtainable as above). Something as minor as including
                                a space or punctuation character in a two-byte font can render a file
                                unreadable.
