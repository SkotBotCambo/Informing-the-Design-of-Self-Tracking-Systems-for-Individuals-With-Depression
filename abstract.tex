In this paper we present findings from a study
that explores the effectiveness of a novel mood-tracking 
as well as implications for a next design iteration.
Participants living with depression were recruited to 
use a smartphone-based passive data collection system 
for 6 weeks.  During this time participants
responded to twice daily experience sampling surveys
and weekly face-to-face interviews for the purpose
of validation and to answer the question 
of how those living with depression use technology
to manage their symptoms.
